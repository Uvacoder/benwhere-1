<p>If you speak to any old asian hand long enough they’ll likely regale you with endless lore of the Bangkok of years past. The stories usually start with Patpong, Soi Cowboy, and heroin addicted soldiers on R&R from the Vietnam war. But, if you dig back even farther in time, the stories usually move onto how Bangkok was once just a wet riverside city sometimes referred to as the Venice of the east.</p>

<p> Legend has it that Bangkok, a city founded in the wet marsh lands on the edge of the Chao Praya river, originally had more canals (khlong in Thai) than roads, with boats being the primary mode of transportation for its residents. Over time many of the khlongs were drained and filled in with cement, forming the modern roadways that criss-cross the city. The commuter boats were traded in for buses, taxis, and motorbikes, and the traffic that Bangkok is famous for was born. </p>

<p>Despite the city’s rapid transformation, you can still find more than a few commuter water buses running daily in the city’s many khlongs. If you don’t mind jumping on and off the sometimes still moving boat when boarding and exiting, squirming through a dense mass of people to find a spot to stand and piece of rope to hold, and dodging the spray of dirty khlong water when the wake of another boat crashes into yours, it’s one of the best ways to get across town. Years ago when I live in Bangkok, it was how I commuted to work everyday, and at 13 baht per trip ($.39) it always seemed like a steal. </p>
