<p>Not long ago I was traveling through Europe with friends and on a whim we took a last minute detour to Fez for a few days. Upon landing I learned 2 things very quickly. First, we were right in the middle of the Ramadan Holiday. Meaning the mostly Muslim residents were abstaining from food, water, and cigarettes from sunrise to sunset. And second, people really did not like having their picture taken without prior permission - their angry reactions were probably not aided by the fact that they were hungry, thirsty, and largely nicotine deprived.</p>

<p>Fez is the kind of place where you wouldn’t be surprised to see Indiana Jones stumble out of an all night poker game that ended with somebody loosing a pinky finger to cover their bets. It is an old city. With a sprawling marketplace (Medina) that appears like a walled off city within a city, full of tunnels and alleyways housing endless little shops and businesses, and crowded with an equal number of hustlers trying to take you to any one of them. It’s said to date back to the 8th century, and though crumbling and in a constant state of repair, is still standing.</p>
