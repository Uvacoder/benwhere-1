                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p class="mb-0">The challenge with email design was to create a delightful experience for the user, completely within our brand style, which converted at a high rate, when that was the goal. For each email campaign, I generally created several versions to be AB tested to find which was the most effective. I worked closely with a copywriter and marketing lead to ensure that the design corresponded perfectly with the subject lines and body copy, and that it clearly communicated the message of the email.</p>
