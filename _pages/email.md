                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p class="mb-0"> The challegne with these projects was to create a delightful and engaging experience for the user, that would quickly communicate a message, without deviating from our brand style. As the messaging for each email varried from a simple account update, to a fraud alert, to new product promotion, the end-goal and success metrics for each campaign also varried greatly. </p>

                         After reviewing the project breif, I generally brainstormed ideas with a copywriter and marketing lead to be sure that all visuals would properly corosponded with subject lines and email copy. Once multiple visuals and copy variations were laid out, we reviewed everything for brand style and voice, and mapped out the elements for AB testing. We worked with the constraints of often having to produce these emails very quickly and with limited ability to the change overall layout.</p>
