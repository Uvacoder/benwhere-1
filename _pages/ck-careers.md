                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>When I started with Credit Karma, they were rapidly scalling in size and had very ambitious hiring goals. At the time, the careers section of their website was very outdated and difficult to navigate through. It was a very competative hiring market for many positions, having a disfunctional careers section would not cut it. It would be most candidates first point of contact with the company, it was imperative that they received a positive first impression and could easily find information about open positions.</p>

                Before diving into any design work, I started with interviewing a few of the new engineers recently hired at the company to get better insight on what things they found most important in a careers section. This helped inform which sections to emphasize, and the overall tone and messaging. I then built out wireframes for the pages and collaborated with copywriters and members from the recruiting team to fine-tune the layout and messaging. The last step was visual design and selecting images.
