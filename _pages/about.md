                <p>I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. My mom came from an art background and my dad from technology. Strange how those things work out. I grew up around computers and the dawn of the internet. I remember when a 28.8 kbit/s modem was fast and Netscape was the new kid on the block.</p>

                <p>I'm one of a rare breed of designers that also enjoys diving into code and working with web development. Some call that unicornish, but it just seems normal to me. I've worked extensively throughout California and abroad and all kinds of design challenges. Have something interesting in the mix? Lets chat.</p>
