                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p class="mb-0">In the wake of the financial collapse of 2008, there was a very strong anti-bank sentiment in the United States, and many consumers were looking to alternatives for their banking needs. US First, a credit untion, was poised to fill that roll. I designed this set of display ads to promote their "Shecking" product â€“ a hybrid saving and checking account. The challenge was to both clearly communicate the value propostions of the account and the fact that US First was a credit union and not a bank.</p>
